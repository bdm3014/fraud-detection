# fraud-detection
fraud detection analysis

Operations:
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M dev
git remote add origin https://github.com/bdm3014/fraud-detection.git
git push -u origin dev

Before doing "git remote add origin", I recommend to setup github token to 
push your code into repository. Generate new token using this link: https://github.com/settings/tokens
